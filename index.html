        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>In converting my resume to HTML, I structured the content using semantic tags for better readability and accessibility. The header contains my name and contact details, followed by different sections like Objective, Education, Skills, Internships, Projects, and Extracurricular Activities. Each section is enclosed within <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags, and lists are formatted using <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements. I used <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags for email and LinkedIn links, ensuring navigation ease. The structure maintains clarity while being machine-readable for search engines and assistive technologies.</p>

        <h3>Stylistic Choices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> I chose Arial as the primary font for its readability and modern appearance. It is a sans-serif font that provides a clean look.</li>
            <li><strong>Heading Sizes:</strong> The main heading (h1) is set to 2.5em to make it prominent, while h2 and h3 are sized at 2em and 1.5em respectively to create a clear hierarchy.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Choices:</strong> I used a light background color (#f4f4f4) for the body to reduce strain on the eyes, with dark text for contrast. Headings are colored in shades of blue and gray to differentiate them from the body text.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin and Padding:</strong> I applied consistent margins and padding to create space between elements, enhancing readability. The article has padding for a clean look, while headings have top margins to separate them from preceding content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
        <p>In my original HTML, I used an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag for the title of my essay because it visually looked better. I have corrected this to use an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, as it is the highest-level heading on the page. This change improves the semantic structure of the document.</p>
